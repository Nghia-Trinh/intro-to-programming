# Activities for Wednesday of 6th Week

## Name: Nolan Trinh


### PART 1: Assembly Language and Machine Language (Review)

- _Consider the following tasks: (1) adding 100 numbers stored in main
  memory, and (2) adding a number to itself 100 times. Although both tasks
  require 100 additions, the second would be executed much more quickly
  than the first would. Why? (Think about the steps you would need to do to
  program each of these tasks in assembly/machine language.) _

  **Your answer goes here.**


The second one can be replicated using simple machine language. On the other hand, the first one would require using much more steps to access and calculate those values stored in side the main memory.

- _Describe at least one advantage of assembly languages over machine
  languages._

  **Your answer goes here.**

This would be much easier to understand for the user to work on.
The assembly language has specific form for us to work on, while the machine languages have specific codes that may get wrong if entered wrong.


- _Describe two advantages of high-level language programming over machine
  language programming._

  **Your answer goes here.**

-Humans may calculate sophisticated equations using high-level languages, where machine language requires to replicate tasks many times in order to perform those equations. High level languages can be understood by anyone, not by simple CPUs.


### PART 2: Truth Tables and Circuits


- _Provide the Boolean formula (in terms of a and b) for the output z in
  the circuit diagram that was provided._

    z = NOT ( (NOT A OR B) AND B )


- _Provide a truth table that shows the inputs a and b and the output z
  corresponding to the circuit diagram that was provided._


|  a  |  b  |  z  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  F  |  F  |  T  |
|  F  |  T  |  F  |
|  T  |  F  |  T  |
|  T  |  T  |  F  |
