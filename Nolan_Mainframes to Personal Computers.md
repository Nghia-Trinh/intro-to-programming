**Title or Topic:**  Mainframes and Personal Computers


**Three things you learned from this video:**

-The chips gets made from sand, which is then melted at a high degree, and the goes through many steps to form into the prts of microprocessor.
-In order to produce the microchips, the scientists must sanitize their workplace to the best. This is becuase the microchips cannot work if they get dust in.
-From the video of "How to make a Microprocessor", we learn that if light is bended and reverted through a glass bulb, it can magnify information from a small unit. This shows that the microprocessors that work on light principles can transmit information much fast.



**Were any of the ideas new or did they cause you to think about some topic
differently than you had before?  What, if anything, did the video or
presentation do for you?  Explain.**

-The process of forming a microprocessor was much of interest to me. This part provided info of from how the boards are designed, to how the manufacturer chooses out what kind of sand to use and how to utilize their steps. This shows that the microchip truly is a leap forward in the history of technology.



**Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest:**
-The actual means of how to make a microprocessor from the video by the Royal Institution of Christmas Lectures did not exclusively explain the process of how to make a microprocessor. This made a much incomplete and confusing statement, also different from what the title says.
