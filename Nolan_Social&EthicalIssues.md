**Title or Topic:**  Social and Ethical Issues


**Three things you learned from this video:**

-The technology we use aroud us are made for humane puposes. It is the people behind them that have social and ethical reasoning.
-IT professionals has to go through an specific set of guidelines when producing technology for people to use.
-There is a specific set of guidelines that has bee made for the computer/machinery to work through. As long as the computer/machinery abides with the guidelines, it is practicing ethical work.

**Were any of the ideas new or did they cause you to think about some topic
differently than you had before?  What, if anything, did the video or
presentation do for you?  Explain.**
-There is an idea that technology as we build it is made to serve the humn race. This is true, as much technology as we see it should not do harm to any people. If they do, this would be an unethical action, which the IT professionals and manufacturers must stand behind and tke responsibility for it.





**Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest:**
-The TED video showed that there are much more depth into building up a set of guidelines for the computer to work on. In order to have a good computer, we need to have specifically written guidelines, which are in much more detail then the general list that we have already known.
