As you respond to the reading(s) in this assignment, please move beyond
summary to reflection.

**Title or Topic:**  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Language.


**Three things you learned from this reading assignment:**

-The deep in "deep learning" implies the deep layers of neural networks that interlinks each other.
-AI research has come pretty much a long way, as for some time the scietists were working hard but was not ble to produce any useful products. These events may be called as the "AI winter". Not until the 80s and 90s, there were a change and people started giving a nnnew approach, called expert or rule-based systems.
-On the contrast of supervised learning, where the machine is given data that is well sorted, unsupervised learning is a technique where the machine will learn from unsorted, messy data.



**Were any of the ideas new or did they cause you to think about some topic
differently than you had before?  What, if anything, did the reading
do for you?  Explain:**
-The idea that the Artificial Inntelligence is made based onn human behaviour is something much raw to me. As to think that the machines will have to analyze down data from much of humans action into bit information, and then "learn" from that information. 






**Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest:**

-"Classic Machine Learning": this is a term which pointed at the method where we would give an algorithm a large set of numbers and then let itself work and study on that data set. This would show that the machines are actually more capable of handling certains tasks that we hand them, as they may react to which we build them accordingly.
