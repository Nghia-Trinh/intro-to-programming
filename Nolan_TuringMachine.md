3. Turing Machine 3:
    Expected Results:
The TM3 has a set of rules which the machine will use to run through the tape it is given. The machine will operate on the symbols on the tape that are selected by the counter. Each rule has a certain 
The TM3 will execute the 1st rule by replacing the symbol "1" with the symbol "b", and then moves the counter to the right.
The TM3 will execute the 2nd rule by replacing the symbol "!" with the symbol "1", and then moves the counter to the right.
The TM3 will execute the 3rd rule by replacing the symbol "1" with the symbol "1", and then moves the counter to the right.


    Actual Results:
The TM3 will execute the tape to add up the unary numbers separated by the "!" symbol. The machine will then display the sum right behind the blank when the machine has finished running.


4. Turing Machine 4:
    Expected Results:
The TM4 will take up rules inide the rule box and then execute the tape boxes. 

    Actual Results:
The machine will subtract the values of the two unary numbers, which are separated by the symbol of "!". The product of the subtraction will be displayed in unary form between the blank boxes.
